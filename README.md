# Design Tools Showcase

A showcase project to evaluate graphics libraries and paid solutions for informed product decision-making.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates and evaluates various graphics libraries to help make informed decisions about which technology to use in production.

## Libraries Under Evaluation

### Open Source Libraries
- **Konva (react-konva)** - Canvas-based 2D graphics library
- **Fabric.js** - Powerful canvas library with interactive object model
- **Paper.js** - Vector graphics scripting framework

### Paid Solutions (Future Evaluation)
- Zakeke
- Customily
- Pacdora

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
